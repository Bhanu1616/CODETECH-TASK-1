### Objective
The objective of this project is to establish a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application using Jenkins. The project aims to automate the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure rapid and reliable delivery of software updates.

### Key Activities
- **Configure Jenkins with Plugins:** Install Jenkins and configure plugins for Git, Maven, SonarQube, and Tomcat integration.
- **Define Jenkins Pipeline:** Create a Jenkinsfile specifying stages for Git checkout, Maven build, SonarQube analysis, and Tomcat deployment.
- **Automate with Git Integration:** Integrate Jenkins with your Git repository to automate pipeline runs triggered by code commits, including automated testing and quality checks.

### Technologies Used
- **Jenkins:** Automation server for orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline stages and tasks.
- **Git:** Version control system for managing and tracking changes in the source code repository.
- **Maven:** Build automation tool used for compiling source code, running tests, and packaging the application.
- **SonarQube:** Code quality and security analysis tool used to perform static code analysis, identify bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
- **Tomcat:** Web server and servlet container used for deploying Java-based web applications.

### Key Insights
- **Automated Efficiency:** Streamlined CI/CD pipeline automation reduces manual tasks, accelerating software delivery and enhancing team productivity.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Integration with SonarQube ensures early detection of code issues, enhancing overall code quality and security.
- **Reliable Deployment:** Jenkins integration with Tomcat enables consistent and scalable application deployment, ensuring reliable delivery across environments.

This project implements a streamlined CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Git, Maven, SonarQube, and Tomcat, enhancing automation and reliability in software deployment.
